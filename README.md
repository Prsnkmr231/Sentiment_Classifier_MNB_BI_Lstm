# Sentiment_Classifier_MNB_BI_Lstm
This projects contains  the source code for naive bayes  and bidirectional LSTM for detecting the sentiment of the the Movie review in the IMDB dataset

Steps for building the architecture
-----------------------------------

1.Importing all the libraries

2.Cleaning the text data using Regualr Expressions library

3.Removing the stopwords and applying the WordNetLemmatizer for stemming.

4.Used CountVectorizer,TFIDF vectorizer, onehot encoding and word2vec for generating the vectors of the words

5.Implemented the Multinomial Naive Byes classifier using scikit-Learn library

6.Implemented the Bidirectional LSTM using tensorflow

7.Trained the Naive Bayes model with the vectors generated by the Countvectorizer or TFIDFVectorizer.

8.Trained the Bidirectioanl LSTM using the embedding vetcors generated by the Word2Vec model.

9.Tested both the models on the test set with the metrics Accuracy,Precision,Recall,and F1 score.
